🚑 Troubleshooting Guide: AWS S3 Static Website Hosting

🔴 Website Not Loading?

📌 Reason: DNS Propagation Delay
✅ Solution:

After updating GoDaddy’s nameservers to Route 53, changes may take 24-48 hours to propagate.

Check the status using:

nslookup yourdomain.com
dig yourdomain.com

If still unresolved, clear your browser cache & DNS cache using:

ipconfig /flushdns  # Windows
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache  # macOS

🔴 "403 Forbidden" Error in S3

📌 Reason 1: Your bucket is private and does not allow public access.
✅ Solution:
1️⃣ Go to AWS S3 → Your Bucket → Permissions
2️⃣ Under "Block Public Access", disable all restrictions
3️⃣ Add this Bucket Policy (Replace your-bucket-name):

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}

4️⃣ Click Save & Try Again

📌 Reason 2: The S3 bucket name and domain name do not match.
✅ Solution:

If your domain is shoppingcarts.life, your S3 bucket must be named exactly:

shoppingcarts.life

If they don’t match, Route 53 alias records won't work!

Fix: Either rename your S3 bucket or update Route 53 to point to the correct S3 endpoint URL.

🔴 Issue: Stuck While Pasting Route 53 Endpoint

📌 Reason: You copied the wrong S3 website endpoint or missed updating the bucket policy.
✅ Solution:
1️⃣ Go to S3 → Static Website Hosting
2️⃣ Copy the exact website endpoint (e.g., http://your-bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com)
3️⃣ In Route 53 → Hosted Zone, create an Alias Record
4️⃣ Paste the correct S3 endpoint
5️⃣ Test your website:

Open a browser

Try accessing: http://yourdomain.com

✅ GoDaddy DNS updated with Route 53 nameservers
✅ S3 bucket public access enabled
✅ Correct bucket policy added
✅ Route 53 alias record points to S3 endpoint
